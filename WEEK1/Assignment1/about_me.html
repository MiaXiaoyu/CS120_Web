        <h2>My Recent Trip</h2>
        <p>
            I recently visited Costa Rica, a beautiful tourist destination in Central America with diverse landscapes. We enjoyed soaking in hot springs, went canyoning, experienced ziplines, and tried surfing. The beaches, volcanoes, and forests were absolutely mesmerizing and made our trip unforgettable.

        <h2>My Favorite Restaurant</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://altiuspgh.com/" target="_blank" class="restaurant-link">ALTIUS</a> is my favorite restaurant. 
            Rated Four Diamond by AAA, Altius is one of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh. Located on Mount Washington, it's hard to imagine how wonderful it is to enjoy a date while admiring the night view. I must say their filet mignon is absolutely delicious!

        <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite food is definitely hot pot. I can recommend a great hot pot restaurant in New York: <a href="https://www.chongqinglaozao.com/" target="_blank" class="restaurant-link">Chongqing Laozao</a>. 
            It's a soup-based style where you can choose different flavored broths, then various ingredients including meats, seafood, and vegetables. You place them in the pot according to your preference, wait a bit for them to cook, and then enjoy. It's incredibly delicious. Hot pot is not only tasty but also a social experience - sitting around the pot with friends and family, chatting while enjoying the food is my favorite way to dine.
